## Rationale
While working on The Odin Project to improve my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills, I thought it would be fun to try making it DBZ themed, as it's an anime that has helped inspire me throughout difficult times.
I also wanted to pay homage to one of the more exciting DBZ sagas.
I managed to have lots of fun with it, as I put in effort to beautify the pages, learn new css, html and javaScript concepts and tools, and it also allowed me to do some video editing which was fun!

### Inspirations
- Dragon Ball Z
- Another DBZ-Themed Rock Paper Scissors GitHub project (check it out at https://appletri.github.io/rock-paper-scissor/ !) I had some ideas to make it more story-driven, but most of the concept is derived from him, especially the beam clash!
